        <h1>'Sadbait': Why algorithms, audiences and creators love to cry online</h1>

        <p><b>People say they don't want to be sad, but their online habits disagree. Content that
            channels sorrow for views has become a ubiquitous part of online culture. Why does
            it work?</b></p>
        <p>Whether you're a state-sponsored misinformation campaign, a content creator trying to
            make it big or a company trying to sell a product, there's one proven way to win followers
            and earn money online: make people feel something.</p>
        <p>Social media platforms have been called out for incentivising creators to make their
            audiences angry. But these critiques tend to focus on content designed to infuriate people
            into engaging with a post, often called "ragebait". It's earned considerable scrutiny and
            even shouldered some of the blame for political polarisation in recent years – but rage 
            isn't the only emotion that leads users to linger in a comments section or repost a video.</p>
        <p>The internet is flooded with what some call 'sadbait'. It gets far less attention, but some
             of today's most successful online content is melancholy and melodramatic. Influencers film 
             themselves crying. Scam artists lure their victims with stories of hard luck. In 2024,
              TikTokers racked up hundreds of millions of views with a forlorn genre of videos called 
              "Corecore", where collages of depressing movie and news clips lay over a bed of depressing
             music. Sadness is a feeling people might think they want to avoid, but gloomy, dark and
            even distressing posts seem to do surprisingly well with both humans and the algorithms that
            cater to them. The success of sadbait can tell us a lot about both the internet, and ourselves.</p>

        <p>"Displays of any kind of strong emotion – anger, sadness, disgust or even laughing – hook viewers,
            " says Soma Basu, an investigative journalist and researcher at Tampere University in Finland
            who studies how media spreads online. Creators know their audience is scrolling through an endless
            stream of videos they could be watching instead, so a clear and urgent emotional appeal can make
            them stay, she says. But according to Basu, there's something about images of grief, in particular,
            that can blur the lines between the audience and the content, creating the opportunity for a special
            kind of connection.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Internet users, like movie audiences and book readers before them, respond to sad and sentimental
            content, and the algorithms reward it"
        </blockquote>
        <p>Sadbait doesn't always have to be sad for viewers, either. Another viral genre of sadbait on Instagram
            and TikTok features slideshows of AI-generated cats meeting heartbreaking ends – paired with a AI
            cover of Billie Eilish's melancholic What Was I Made For that replaces the lyrics with "meows". These
            miserable kittens became so popular that Eilish performed the meowed version of the song at Madison
            Square Garden in October, with the audience joyfully singing along.</p>
        <p>Nor does sadbait have to depict real, feeling humans. In the spring of 2024, AI-generated images of
            wounded veterans and impoverished children dominated Facebook feeds, becoming some of the most interacted
            -with posts on the platform, according to researchers. When an AI image depicting an imaginary victim of
            Hurricane Helene went viral in the US, right wing influencers and even a Republican politician responded
            that "it doesn't matter" that the picture was fake because it resonated with people. Real or not, people
            love to be in their feelings.</p>
